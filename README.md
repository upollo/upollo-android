# Upollo Android Client Library

Upollo is a service to help turn repeat signups and account sharers into
paying customers, while keeping bad actors out. Learn more about it at
[upollo.ai](https://upollo.ai).

This library is for integrating Upollo smarts into your Android
Application. It is currently intended to be used with Kotlin or Java code,
via the Maven Central Repository, but you may have luck with other setups.
